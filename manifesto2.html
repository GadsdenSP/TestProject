  <h1>Project Anne – A Practical Manifesto</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>I. The Problem</strong><br>
    Digital content is no longer verifiable by default. What you see may not be real. What you hear may never have happened. The systems that carry truth also carry forgeries—and they treat both the same.</p>

    <p><strong>II. The Motivation</strong><br>
    We are not here to fight artificial intelligence. We are not here to punish creators. We are here because people are losing the ability to prove what is real. Anne exists to restore that ability—not through censorship, but through structure.</p>

    <p><strong>III. The Protocol</strong><br>
    Project Anne is a lightweight protocol that wraps content in a verifiable shell. This shell can include signatures, timestamps, device information, AI metadata, endorsements, and more. All optional. All auditable.</p>

    <p><strong>IV. Why It Matters</strong><br>
    When veracity becomes optional, power favors deception. Anne flips this: if a claim matters, it must come with a chain of trust. If it doesn’t, it can be ignored. We believe integrity should be easier than forgery—not the other way around.</p>

    <p><strong>V. Our Position</strong><br>
    We support AI, open creation, and pseudonymity. We support anyone willing to assert something with accountability. Anne doesn’t tell you what to trust. It just shows you who’s willing to sign what.</p>

    <p><strong>VI. What We Want</strong><br>
    We want developers to build. We want artists to assert authorship. We want whistleblowers to prove their footage is untampered. We want platforms to let users decide trust thresholds, using Anne as a base layer of reality-checking.</p>

    <p><strong>VII. What We Refuse</strong><br>
    We refuse a future where every claim is fake until viral. We refuse passive acceptance of deepfakes, info ops, and plausibly deniable lies. We refuse to surrender the idea that reality can be verified.</p>

    <p><strong>VIII. Get Involved</strong><br>
    Anne is free. And it's free because it's valuable. Adopt the protocol. Extend it. Break it. Or just use it to mark your work as yours. Every adoption strengthens the network of truth.</p>
