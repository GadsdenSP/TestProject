    <h2>I. Manifesto</h2>
    <p>
      In a world where digital content proliferates without bounds, the need for verifiable truth,
      transparent authorship, and traceable origins has become essential...

    <h2>II. How It Works</h2>
  
    <p>
      Anne allows any digital file — photo, video, text, AI output — to be sealed with proof of origin, authorship, and time. Unlike anything else in the world, Anne creates trust without relying on platforms or institutions.
    </p>
  
    <div id="fullExplanation" style="display: none;">
      <p>
        Anne is not an app. It is not a platform, and it is not a product. It is a protocol — a standard that anyone can adopt to make digital content verifiable from the moment it is created.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you create a piece of content — whether that’s a photo, a video, an AI-generated sentence, or a handwritten poem scanned into your phone — Anne gives you a way to package that file with proof: proof of authorship, proof of origin, and proof of timing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The file is first hashed. This means it is turned into a cryptographic fingerprint — a unique code that will only ever match that exact file. If even one pixel or character changes, the fingerprint becomes invalid. It is the digital equivalent of sealing an envelope with wax: once broken, it cannot be resealed the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, the creator — whether a person, a device, or even an AI system — signs this fingerprint. This signature links the content to its origin. The signature can be anonymous, pseudonymous, or public. It can be tied to a wallet, a device key, a platform identity, or a private key held by a journalist, artist, or citizen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then comes metadata: the package stores information about when the content was created, how, and where — all depending on what the creator chooses to include. It may list the device used (like a specific camera model), whether an AI was involved (and which one), or the app that was used to generate it. This part is flexible, open, and extendable.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this — the hash, the signature, the metadata — is bundled into a small JSON-based file called an Anne Package. It travels with the content or alongside it. Anyone who sees the file can choose to verify its integrity using simple open tools, or ignore it altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others — news agencies, whistleblower platforms, researchers, even AIs — can endorse a package. Their signatures are added like stamps in a passport. These endorsements don’t guarantee truth — but they guarantee traceability and accountability. You can choose whom to trust based on who was willing to sign.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is this important? Because no mainstream standard exists to prove who made a file, when it was made, or whether it has been altered. The internet is overflowing with manipulated content. Anne doesn’t block or censor — it exposes what can be proven.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a future filled with deepfakes and AI mimicry, Anne gives people one final edge: the ability to say, “This file has a past. And here’s how you can check it.”

    <h2>III. Protocol</h2>
    <p>Each file is hashed, signed, and wrapped in a verifiable package. This package contains origin metadata, creation time, optional device/AI details, and can include endorsements from others.</p>
