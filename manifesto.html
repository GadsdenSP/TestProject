        Project Anne Manifesto

I. Premise

In a world where digital content proliferates without bounds, the need for verifiable truth, transparent authorship, and traceable origins has become essential. Project Anne exists to fulfill this needâ€”not by enforcing control, but by providing an open framework through which integrity can be asserted, verified, and preserved.

II. Purpose

Project Anne is an open protocol for the authentication of digital content. It is designed to serve creators, observers, verifiers, and systems that require trust in what is produced and consumed online. Anne offers a minimal, interoperable, and extensible structure that binds content to its origin, context, and endorsements.

III. Principles

1. Truth Without Authority  
   Truth should not require institutional gatekeepers. Project Anne is built to empower individuals and communities to assert and verify content authenticity without reliance on centralized trust.

2. Transparency by Design  
   Every content package in Anne reveals its own provenance. Metadata such as time, origin, device, and AI involvement are embedded and inspectable by any verifier.

3. Accountability Without Exposure  
   Anne enables anonymous or pseudonymous origin claims, but binds those claims cryptographically. Reputation and identity are portable, not imposed.

4. Interoperability  
   The protocol is platform-agnostic. It can be adopted in decentralized networks, Web2 platforms, and embedded systems alike. Its implementation must not depend on any specific infrastructure.

5. Extensibility  
   Anne is a starting point, not a limit. Anyone can extend the structure to support additional fields, layers, or mechanisms for verification and use-case-specific features.

6. Simplicity and Auditability  
   The structure and process must remain understandable. Anne favors transparency over obfuscation, and minimalism over complexity. Anyone should be able to audit a package.

IV. Rejection of Manipulation

Project Anne refuses to participate in the digital economy of confusion, forgery, and information laundering. It rejects the normalization of manipulated media without accountability, algorithmic amplification of unverifiable content, and the passive erosion of truth.

V. Invitation

Anne is an open system. It invites developers, journalists, creators, and researchers to build upon it, critique it, and evolve it. The protocol belongs to no one and is answerable only to its principles.

VI. Responsibility

Those who implement Anne bear the responsibility to preserve its integrity. The protocol should not be subverted to obfuscate, deceive, or impose coercive control.

Project Anne is not a product. It is a commitment to verifiable reality in the digital age.
