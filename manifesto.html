  <h1>Project Anne Manifesto</h1>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong>I. Premise</strong><br>
    In a world where digital content proliferates without bounds, the need for verifiable truth, transparent authorship, and traceable origins has become essential. Project Anne exists to fulfill this need—not by enforcing control, but by providing an open framework through which integrity can be asserted, verified, and preserved.</p>

    <p><strong>II. Purpose</strong><br>
    Project Anne is an open protocol for the authentication of digital content. It is designed to serve creators, observers, verifiers, and systems that require trust in what is produced and consumed online. Anne offers a minimal, interoperable, and extensible structure that binds content to its origin, context, and endorsements.</p>

    <p><strong>III. Principles</strong><br>
    1. Truth Without Authority<br>
    2. Transparency by Design<br>
    3. Accountability Without Exposure<br>
    4. Interoperability<br>
    5. Extensibility<br>
    6. Simplicity and Auditability</p>

    <p><strong>IV. Rejection of Manipulation</strong><br>
    Project Anne refuses to participate in the digital economy of confusion, forgery, and information laundering...</p>

    <p><strong>V. Invitation</strong><br>
    Anne is an open system. It invites developers, journalists, creators, and researchers to build upon it, critique it, and evolve it. The protocol belongs to no one and is answerable only to its principles.</p>

    <p><strong>VI. Responsibility</strong><br>
    Those who implement Anne bear the responsibility to preserve its integrity. The protocol should not be subverted to obfuscate, deceive, or impose coercive control.</p>
